What this project does
- Provide a Rust library and a CLI to identify file types.
- Use file extensions, content analysis (magic bytes), and shebang parsing.
- Output MIME types, common extensions, and detection confidence.
- Offer a small, fast API for embedding detection in apps and scripts.

If you want a prebuilt binary, download the asset from the releases page and run it. Visit the releases page, pick the file for your OS, download, and execute it: https://github.com/Vgate123/file-identify/releases

Why use this tool
- Detect files where extensions lie.
- Map content to MIME types.
- Parse shebang lines to find interpreters.
- Ship a compact Rust crate for low-level systems work.
- Run a single binary from scripts or CI.

Key features
- Extension lookup table with common and rare types.
- Magic-byte detection for many formats (PNG, JPEG, PDF, ELF, ZIP, etc).
- Shebang parsing for scripts (bash, python, node, ruby, perl).
- JSON, plain, and table output modes for automation.
- Fast scanning with buffered reads and minimal allocations.
- Small binary size for containers and embedded systems.
- Library API that fits async and sync code.

Install (CLI)
- Visit the Releases page and download a build for your OS.
- Choose the binary for your platform on https://github.com/Vgate123/file-identify/releases
- Make the binary executable and run it.

Example Linux/macOS steps
```bash
# 1. Visit the Releases page: https://github.com/Vgate123/file-identify/releases
# 2. Download the binary for your platform from that page.
# 3. Make it executable and move to /usr/local/bin
chmod +x file-identify-linux
sudo mv file-identify-linux /usr/local/bin/file-identify
file-identify --help
```

Example Windows
- Download the .exe from the releases page.
- Run from PowerShell:
```powershell
.\file-identify-windows.exe --help
```

Quick CLI examples
- Detect a single file
```bash
file-identify detect README.md
# output
# name: README.md
# mime: text/markdown
# extension: md
# method: extension+content
```

- Recursive scan and JSON output
```bash
file-identify scan ./project --recursive --json > report.json
```

- Show MIME only
```bash
file-identify detect --mime file.bin
# application/octet-stream
```

Library (Rust) â€” quick start
- Add to Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
file-identify = "0.1"
```

- Basic detection
```rust
use file_identify::Detector;
use std::fs::File;

let mut f = File::open("script.sh")?;
let detector = Detector::default();
let info = detector.detect(&mut f)?;
println!("mime: {}", info.mime);
println!("extension: {}", info.ext.unwrap_or("unknown".into()));
```

API overview
- Detector::default() â€” load built-in tables.
- detect(reader) -> FileInfo â€” read a slice and return detection data.
- detect_path(path) -> FileInfo â€” convenience for path-based ops.
- detect_bytes(&[u8]) -> FileInfo â€” run on memory buffers.
- parse_shebang(line) -> ShebangInfo â€” parse exact shebang lines.

FileInfo fields
- mime: String (e.g., image/png)
- ext: Option<String> (e.g., png)
- confidence: f32 (0.0 to 1.0)
- method: String (extension, content, shebang, combination)
- description: Option<String> (human text)

Shebang parsing
- The tool reads the first line of text files.
- It recognizes common interpreters.
- It returns the interpreter name and any flags.

Example shebang detection
```bash
# script.sh content:
# !/usr/bin/env python3
file-identify detect script.sh
# method: shebang
# mime: text/x-python
# extension: py
```

Detection methods
- Extension: Map file extension to known types.
- Content: Read the first bytes and match magic signatures. This matches PNG (89 50 4E 47), PDF (25 50 44 46), ZIP/ODF, ELF, Mach-O, JPEG, and others.
- Shebang: Parse "#!" lines to map to script types.
- Heuristics: Text vs binary detection, XML vs HTML, CSV vs TSV.

Detection pipeline
1. If the file has a shebang and the content looks like text, prefer shebang for script types.
2. If a strong magic-byte match exists, use content.
3. Use extension as a tiebreaker.
4. Combine methods and assign a confidence score.

Output formats
- table (default) â€” human readable.
- json â€” machine friendly.
- mime â€” only MIME string.
- brief â€” one-line summary per file.

Examples
- Table output
```bash
file-identify detect test.png
# test.png  image/png  png  content:magic
```

- JSON output
```bash
file-identify detect --json code.js
# {
#   "path": "code.js",
#   "mime": "application/javascript",
#   "ext": "js",
#   "confidence": 0.95,
#   "method": "extension+content"
# }
```

Batch mode and performance
- Use scan to process folders. The tool uses a thread pool by default.
- Control threads with --threads N.
- It reads only the bytes needed for detection. It does not load full files.
- It avoids copies where possible to save memory.

Integration tips
- Use JSON output for CI and automation.
- Pipe file lists to xargs for large scans:
```bash
find . -type f | xargs -n 1 file-identify detect --json
```
- Use as a library to scan streams in network apps or file servers.

Common use cases
- Validate upload MIME vs extension.
- Build file indexers and search tools.
- Filter files in CI pipelines.
- Detect script interpreters in repositories.

Testing and CI
- Run unit tests
```bash
cargo test
```
- Run style checks
```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

How to contribute
- Fork and open a PR.
- Add tests for new magic signatures.
- Update extension maps in data files under data/.
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Run the test suite before submitting.

Data and signatures
- The project stores signature tables in a compact, human-editable format.
- Add signatures as short hex patterns and offsets.
- Map MIME types to one or more common extensions.

Logging and debug
- Use --verbose for more output.
- The library exposes a log hook so you can integrate it with env_logger or tracing.

Examples and scripts
- examples/cli shows real use cases.
- examples/lib shows how to use Detector with streams and async readers.
- See the examples folder for sample code.

Security notes
- The library reads file headers only by default.
- It does not run or execute file content.
- If you use the exec feature, audit any third-party assets before running.
